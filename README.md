A very inefficient implementation of a small subset of Python, inspired by CPython

## Working on...

Split AST compilation step into tokenizer and recursive descent parser. 

1. Start basic tokenizer. Done!
2. Handle `T_INDENT` and `T_DEDENT`... doing! 

## To-do eventually...

 - free our memory at some point :P
 - refcounting
